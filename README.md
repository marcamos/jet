It’s (j)ust (e)leventy and (t)ailwind … OK, and a few other things; it’s still *really* small though.

## Goal
[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) are my favorite things right now.

While learning how to use Eleventy, I came across [a few starter projects](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) that combine it with Tailwind CSS, which is _amazing_, but they also come with so much more.

Personally, I _only_ want Eleventy and Tailwind … and, taking the desire for simplicity one step further, I only want to use them via NPM scripts.

So, I made this and it seems to work 🤷‍♀️

## How you can use it
1. [Create your own new repo from jet’s template](https://github.com/marcamos/jet/generate), or [clone this one](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Install dependencies: `npm i`
3. Start development: `npm run dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:8080 to see your work-in-progress
5. Do super-fun Eleventy and Tailwind things
6. When you’re done: `npm run build`
7. Host your project somewhere ([Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) are nice options)

That’s it 🕺
